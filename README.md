# Large-Scale User and Question Management System

This Django project is designed to manage Users and Questions at scale, dealing with a considerable amount of data: 10M Users and 1M Questions. The system provides APIs for managing users, questions, favorite questions, and read questions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Django 3.2
- Django REST framework

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/Large-Scale-User-Question-Management.git```

2. Change into the project directory:

```cd large_scale_management```


3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```python3 -m venv env```

```source env/bin/activate # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate```

4. Install the required packages:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

5. Apply the database migrations:

```python3 manage.py migrate```

6. Run the development server:

```python3 manage.py runserver```


The API endpoints will be available at `http://localhost:8000/api/`.

## API Endpoints

1. Count Favorite and Read Questions for a User:

```GET /api/users/int:user_id/counts/```


This endpoint provides the count of favorite and read questions for a specific user.

2. Filter Questions by Status:

```GET /api/questions/str:status/```

This endpoint filters questions based on their status (read, unread, favorite, or unfavorite).

## Testing

To run the unit tests:

```python3 manage.py test```


The tests cover the API views, data generation, and database functionality.

## Scalability and Deployment

For handling large-scale data and deployment, consider the following strategies:

- Database Optimization: Optimize database queries and indexes to improve performance.

- Containerization: Use containerization technologies like Docker for consistency and portability.

- Orchestration: Deploy with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes for scalability and load balancing.

- CI/CD Pipelines: Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
